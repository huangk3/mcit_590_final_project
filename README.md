## Summary

Our project finds clinically similar patients from a given set of patient population. It calculates the similarity between the *index* patient and all other `n` patients.  

The program reads in the data from a CSV file and creates a list of clinical encounters.  Using the list of clinical encounters, the software builds a clinical utilization for each patient profile (`HashMap`).  The unique patient identifier (`patient_number`) is the key and the patient's clincial profile is stored as value. The patient level clinical profile is created by averaging a patient's inpatient visits, outpatient visits, procedures, medications, lab procedures, and emergency visits.  These patient clinical utilization profiles are used to compute *similarity* between patients.  We used two methods to calculate the similiarity between patient's prfile, *Euclidean distance* and *Cosine distance*.  

The clinical profile is a vector of patient level measures. We compare the *index* patient’s clinical profile with all other patients’ clinical profiles to calculate similarity metric and return list of patient's which are within user provided threshold of similarity from *index* patient. The distance measure value ranges from 0 (*most similar*) to 1 (*least similar*)

## Distance measures

#### Euclidean distance

Euclidean distance is the distance between two points and is calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem

(Rosalind 2020).  

For the $$k$$-dimentional data this formula is generalizd to following form

Given, $$p_1 = \left\{p_{1i},p_{1j},\ldots,p_{1k}\right\}$$ and $$p_2 = \left\{p_{2i},p_{2j},\ldots,p_{2k}\right\}$$ *educlidean distance* $$d(p_1,p_2)$$ is

$$ d(p_1,p_2) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=i}^k(p_{1i}-p_{2i})^2}$$

We used scaled version of *euclidean distance* for our software, to force the range of values between 0 and 1 for easy interpretability. 

we calcualted a maximum possible squared discrepency for each variable. If $$m$$ are the number of patients in the given sample, we caculated maximum squared discrepancy for variable $$i$$ is given by

$$md_{i} = (\max(p_{1i},p_{2i},p_{3i},\ldots,p_{mi}) - \min(p_{1i},p_{2i},p_{3i},\ldots,p_{mi}))^2$$

then *scaled euclidean distance* is calculated as,

$$d_{s}(p1,p2) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{k}(\frac{(p_{1i}-p_{1i})^2}{md_{i}})}$$

#### Cosine distance

The Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity is inner product space of two non-zero vectors, which measures cosine of angle between two vectors. 

Given, $$p_1 = \left\{p_{1i},p_{1j},\ldots,p_{1k}\right\}$$ and $$p_2 = \left\{p_{2i},p_{2j},\ldots,p_{2k}\right\}$$ , the *cosine* similarity is calculated as,

$$\cos(\theta) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k p_{1i}p_{2i}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^k} p_{1i}^2\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^k p_{2i}^2}}$$

*cosine distance* is calcualted as $$1-cos(\theta)$$


# Project Flow

The user runs the MainFrame.java file and the window below is displayed.

![ScreenOne](ScreenOne.png)

The "Import Data button" allows the user to select the "diabetic_data.csv" provided patient data.  The `MainFrame` then executes the `DataReader` class to read data into `ClinicalEncounters` class. Then methods in`PatientProcessor` class are executed to build `HashMap` of `Patient` class. Data from the `Patient` class is displayed in the window as below.

![ScreenTwo](ScreenTwo.png)

Once the data is imported the user can view and select an index patient for comparison against all other patients.

![ScreenThree](ScreenThree.png)

Once the user has selected the index patient, the user can either copy and paste or type in the patient ID into the Index Patient box. Additionally the user can choose Euclidean or Cosine distance calculations. Finally the user must enter a threshold value of 0 - 1 and then click submit. The MainFrame then executes PatientProcessor and Patient classes to develop profile HashMap. Finally the methods in `DataAnaylsis`, `ClusteringFrame`,` Plots`,` DataDisplay`,` mapValueCompatator` are called to calculate similarity values and display those values into three JCharts seen below.

![ScreenFour](ScreenFour.png)

The window then displays Race Distribution of patients, Gender distribution, and the Clustering plot.
